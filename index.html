                <ul id="description">
                    <p>I graduated from the University of Missouri in May of 2022 with a bachelor of health science, with an emphasis in health and rehabilitation science. My career at Mizzou started
                        with my pursuit of a degree in computer science, however, after my first year I decided to take a year off to reevaulate what it was I wanted to do with my life. After the year off I 
                        decided on pursuing physical therapy instead of software development. In my last two semester I did more research on the degree path and the programs I could get into and realized that the programs
                        for this degree are more competitive and extensive than I orginally thought. With physical therapy out of the picture I tried picking up programming again by taking free courses on Codecademy.com.
                        I refound the same passion I originally had for development and decided to continue my lessons while finishing up my health science degree.
